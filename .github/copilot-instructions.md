This is a complete C++ JUCE audio plugin project that integrates with the ai-band-backend for AI-generated MIDI playback.

## Project Status: âœ… COMPLETE

### Project Structure
- C++ JUCE audio plugin (VST3/AU/Standalone)
- Loads MIDI files from ai-band-backend
- Real-time MIDI playback synchronized with DAW
- Prepared for future ai-band-orchestrator integration

### Completed Components
- **PluginProcessor**: Core audio processing and MIDI handling
- **PluginEditor**: Complete user interface with file browser
- **MidiManager**: Full MIDI file loading and management
- **NetworkClient**: Placeholder for orchestrator communication

### Build System
- CMake configuration for cross-platform builds
- JUCE framework integration (.jucer file included)
- Support for VST3, AU, and Standalone formats
- Windows setup script (setup.bat)

### Integration Points
- Folder monitoring for automatic MIDI file detection
- Compatible with ai-band-backend output format
- Placeholder network code for orchestrator integration
- Test file generator included

### Ready for Use
- Complete source code implementation
- Comprehensive documentation (README.md)
- Build configurations for Windows, macOS, Linux
- Example configuration and test files
- Integration guidelines for ai-band-orchestrator

### Next Steps
1. Install JUCE Framework
2. Run setup.bat (Windows) or build with CMake
3. Load plugin in DAW
4. Test with ai-band-backend generated files
5. Extend NetworkClient when orchestrator is available
